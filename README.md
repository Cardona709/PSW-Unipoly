## Overview

Our Unipoly game project was created as a part of Software Design project, showcasing the application of C++ programming and object-oriented principles. The goal is to provide an interactive console-based implementation of the classic Monopoly board game.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay:** Enjoy a console-based gaming experience with multiple players.
- **Property Transactions:** Buy and sell properties to build your real estate empire.
- **Chance and Community Chest Cards:** Encounter unexpected events with a variety of cards.
- **Jail and Free Parking:** Experience the challenges and bonuses associated with Jail and Free Parking.

## Getting Started

<!---
To run the Unipoly game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/unipoly-game.git
    cd unipoly-game
    ```

2. Compile the code:

    ```bash
    g++ -o unipoly-game main.cpp logic/*.cpp
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    ./unipoly-game
    ``` -->

Ensure you have a C++ compiler (in this case, g++) installed on your machine.

## Unit Testing

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, undergo thorough examination to ensure their correct and reliable operation. In order to perform Unit Testing in this project, follow these steps:

1. In VSCode, do Ctrl+Shift+P, which brings up the Command Palette, and select CMake: Run Tests;

2. Then, if you wish to see further information, run in the terminal:

    ```bash
    ./build/unit_test/GameTests
    ```
